# Welcome to sshthings - My First Blog Post

Hello and welcome to **sshthings**! This is my personal blog where I'll be sharing my journey through self-hosting, infrastructure automation, and technology experiments.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a variety of topics including:

- **Self-Hosting Projects**: Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, and home server setups
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines
- **Cloud Solutions**: AWS, Azure, and multi-cloud strategies
- **DevOps Practices**: Monitoring, logging, and security best practices
- **Technology Experiments**: New tools, frameworks, and methodologies

## My Background

I'm a Lead Systems Engineer with over 13 years of experience in cloud infrastructure, automation, and security. I've worked with various technologies and platforms, and I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and learning from the community.

## Why "sshthings"?

The name "sshthings" represents my focus on **self-hosting** and **infrastructure** projects. SSH (Secure Shell) is a fundamental tool for managing remote systems, and it symbolizes the technical foundation of the topics I'll be covering here.

## My Approach

I believe in:
- **Learning in Public**: Sharing both successes and failures
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world implementations and code snippets
- **Community Focus**: Engaging with others who share similar interests
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always exploring new technologies and approaches

Stay tuned for more content about self-hosting adventures, automation experiments, and infrastructure insights!
